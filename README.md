Android Location Tester
==========================================================================================
This is an android application to test Location service. You can play around with changing parameters of Location request. This application uses both LocationManager and Google Play services (Fused Location). So you can switch between them and check the location updates. 
When you press "Start location" button, the location is logged in the root directory of the device in a .txt file. You can use the data later to compare for accurate paths.
